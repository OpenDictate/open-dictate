# OpenDictate for macOS

A native menu bar application built with SwiftUI, AppKit, AVAudioEngine,
Accessibility, Keychain and URLSession. No third-party dependencies or backend.

## Installation

```bash
brew install --cask lebedev-nikita/tap/open-dictate
```

See the [setup guide](../../README.md#install-on-macos) for permissions and
manual installation, and the [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/lebedev-nikita/homebrew-tap#readme)
for upgrades and migration from a manually installed DMG.

## Development

Requires macOS 14+ and Xcode 16+ (Swift 5.9 package, compatible with Swift 6).

```bash
swift test --package-path apps/macos
apps/macos/scripts/package.sh
open dist/macos/OpenDictate.app
```

Open `Package.swift` in Xcode for source editing and debugging. Run the bundled
app for permission testing: a bare Swift executable has a different TCC identity.
The universal build targets `arm64` and `x86_64`, with a macOS 14 deployment target.

## Runtime

- `AppModel` owns a single session, immutable settings, cancellation, permissions
  and result delivery. Session UUIDs discard late callbacks.
- `TextTarget` captures the focused Accessibility element, process, value and
  UTF-16 selection. Every insertion rechecks focus, text and caret. Both modes
  capture the active eligible field when ordinary dictation stops, then paste
  one final result into its latest selection. Voice
  editing retains its captured source selection. Cancel before delivery leaves the field untouched.
- `HotKeys` uses exclusive Carbon registration for ordinary key combinations.
  Globe/Fn combinations and modifier-only taps use AppKit event monitors with
  the existing Accessibility permission, without requesting Input Monitoring.
  Only key codes and modifier flags are inspected; typed characters are not read
  or stored. Holding a shortcut does not repeatedly toggle dictation. Escape is
  registered only during recording/processing (or when explicitly assigned).
- `AudioRecorder` copies tap buffers and converts on a serial worker to mono
  PCM16 at 24 kHz. Chunks are 40 ms. Live audio stays off disk; Accurate builds
  a WAV in memory. Both stop below the provider's 25 MB upload limit.
- `LiveTranscriptionSession` opens immediately, bounds early audio to 300 chunks,
  flushes after `session.updated`, serializes sends and explicitly commits.
  Overflow fails visibly instead of silently dropping speech.
- `OpenAIClient` uses ephemeral HTTPS sessions. Voice edits and explicit AI
  history searches use structured Responses output with `store: false`.
- `RecordingIndicator` owns a nonactivating panel that cannot become key/main.
  Settings choose Microphone (the existing 55 × 27.5 pt finish control) or Waveform
  (a black 62.5 × 28.32 pt capsule with ten white level bars, ranging from
  2.5 pt in silence to 17.5 pt at full level). At full level, the waveform
  spans 38.63 × 17.5 pt; capsule width / waveform width and capsule height /
  waveform height both equal the golden ratio, with 5.41 pt vertical insets.
  New input appears on
  the right and older levels move left, using the existing 40 ms microphone
  level callbacks. Only ten normalized RMS levels live in memory and are cleared
  on every session exit. The HUD alone observes those updates, without rebuilding
  menu state. Click the red button or waveform capsule to stop/submit without
  moving focus. Preparation already offers the finish action; processing shows
  a native spinner in a 27.5 × 27.5 pt circle for either style, restoring
  the original vertical spacing around the spinner.
- The HUD never takes keyboard focus. Ordinary dictation continues while typing,
  moving the caret or switching fields/windows/apps. Stopping captures the active eligible field for delivery.
  Voice editing still requires the original text and selection to remain unchanged.
  Voice editing stops and detaches when its original source changes. Revoking
  Accessibility or sleeping cancels a recording. Switching fields after stopping
  detaches delivery. Final results remain available to copy.

Supported editors expose an Accessibility string value and selected text range.
On activation and before capture, OpenDictate enables supported
`AXManualAccessibility` / `AXEnhancedUserInterface` flags so Electron editors
such as T3 Code expose their focused field even without VoiceOver. This
preparation reads only those flags and skips excluded apps; it does not activate
windows or read unrelated UI contents.
All applications receive one final clipboard paste, including Chrome, native editors
and T3 Code. Live still streams recognition immediately, but delivery to the field
happens when recording finishes, just like Accurate. Accessibility is used to
validate the process and exact field captured at stop, capture its latest value
and UTF-16 selection for ordinary dictation, and to select
the whole field for voice editing when no text was selected. Voice editing validates
the unchanged source text and selection. Once clipboard delivery begins, any further
text or selection change rejects the paste. No AX text writes or
application-specific insertion exceptions remain. Paste is posted once to the captured
process and verified with a bounded 800 ms readback window; unacknowledged pastes
are never retried. The previous clipboard items and types are restored if unchanged.
Temporary transcript items are marked confidential for compatible clipboard utilities.
Editors without usable Accessibility metadata need manual Copy last transcript.
Password fields are deliberately excluded.

### Speech languages

Settings → Dictation → Speech languages opens a searchable list of 64 languages
with native checkboxes. Select any combination without closing the list. Search
by English, Russian or native name, or an ISO language code such as `de`.
Automatic detection clears the selection and sends no language hints. Changes
save immediately and apply to the next Live or Accurate session; selection is
disabled during dictation. Existing single-language and Russian + English
preferences migrate automatically. Language hints remain local preferences.

### Optional punctuation correction

Settings → Dictation → **Correct punctuation** appears only in Accurate mode
and is off by default.
When enabled, only ordinary Accurate dictation sends its recognized text to
`gpt-6-luna` for punctuation/capitalization through Responses (`store: false`,
`reasoning.effort: none`). Live and voice editing skip this step. Local word
replacements apply afterward. No separate final-period override is applied. Invalid edits or
request failures retain the original transcription; cancellation prevents delivery.
The switch is saved only on this Mac and does not sync through Google Drive.

### Retranscribe the last recording

Choose **Retranscribe last recording** in the menu bar to recognize the latest
ordinary Live or Accurate recording again through Accurate, without recording
new audio. The command uses the current Accurate model, speech languages,
dictionary, timeout, punctuation option and word replacements. The selected
dictation mode stays unchanged. Results are inserted into the eligible field
focused when you invoke the command; switching fields during processing prevents
insertion. With no eligible field (including secure or excluded fields), the
result stays available through Copy/Paste last transcript and optional history.
Escape cancels processing and leaves the recording available for another try.

Only one recording, bounded by the existing eight-minute limit, is retained in
memory. It remains available after recognition succeeds or fails, until the next
ordinary dictation starts or the app quits. Cancelling a new recording discards
it; voice-edit instructions are never retained for retry and do not replace the
last ordinary recording. No audio is written to disk or synced. The command is
disabled while busy or when there is no recording to retry.

### Word replacements

Settings → Word replacements manages local “recognized phrase → replacement”
rules. Add, edit, delete, enable individual rules or turn all replacements off.
Matching ignores case, respects Unicode word boundaries, prefers longer phrases
and never cascades into another rule. Replacement spelling is preserved exactly.
Live applies completed words immediately; an unfinished trailing token waits for
a boundary or the final result. Accurate applies rules before delivery.
Each session captures its rules at startup, and history/copy use the same result.
Voice editing instructions and results are not modified. Up to 500 rules, with
256 UTF-16 units per phrase and 2,048 per replacement.

Rules are applied locally and remain separate from dictionary hints sent to OpenAI.
Connect Google Drive in Settings to sync the rule list, individual rule states and
the master switch with Android.

### Appearance

The theme button at the top right of Settings offers System, Light and Dark.
The choice is saved locally and applies across all settings pages. Dark preserves
the previous default; System follows macOS. The recording indicator remains dark.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Command-W closes the current settings window. Command-Shift-W closes all regular
application windows while preserving the recording indicator. Reopen Settings
from the menu bar or with Command-comma while the app is active.

In Settings, click either shortcut and press the desired combination. Letters,
symbols, navigation, numpad and F1–F20 keys work with any combination of Control,
Option, Shift and Command, or without modifiers. Dictation and voice editing are
configured independently; their defaults remain Option+Space and Option+Shift+Space.
Existing preferences migrate automatically. Escape clears the shortcut; either or both can remain unassigned. Dictation and voice editing are still available from the menu;
use the adjacent key menu to assign Escape, an F-key, or Globe/Fn directly.
During an active dictation, unmodified Escape always cancels even if assigned.
Conflicting registrations leave the previous shortcut working and show an error.

Press and release modifiers to assign a modifier-only shortcut, including
Globe/Fn. Modifier-only shortcuts fire on release; using the modifier with another
key does not start dictation. Globe/Fn with an ordinary key is also supported.
These monitored shortcuts do not suppress system/other-app actions. In macOS
Keyboard settings, set “Press 🌐 key to” to “Do Nothing” to avoid input-source,
emoji or system dictation actions. Accessibility must be allowed. Some external
keyboards handle Fn in firmware and never send its events to macOS.

For F1–F12, enable “Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys” under Keyboard
→ Keyboard Shortcuts → Function Keys, or hold Fn when pressing the key. The recorder
normalizes the function flag on F/navigation keys so they remain ordinary keys.
Keys reserved by macOS or intercepted by keyboard firmware cannot be guaranteed.
See [Apple's function-key guide](https://support.apple.com/102439) and
[AppKit event monitoring](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/MonitoringEvents/MonitoringEvents.html).

Credentials live in a device-only, non-synchronizing Keychain item. Preferences
use the app's UserDefaults domain. The last 500 completed transcripts are saved
in `~/Library/Application Support/OpenDictate/history.json` with owner-only
permissions. Disable history to stop saving future results; delete existing
history separately. Audio is never persisted on macOS.

## Verification

Unit tests exercise UTF-16 selections, cumulative updates, cursor guards,
WAV/chunk boundaries, protocol payloads, ordered early-audio flush and commit,
bounded queues, cancellation, local search and history batching. Mock transport
tests do not require a key or call OpenAI.

For native smoke checks, run `scripts/build-smoke.sh` and
`scripts/build-editor-fixture.sh`, then launch the printed app paths. The smoke
bundle enables local-only checks automatically; other debug bundles accept
`--local-smoke-test`.
This debug-only mode uses the real shortcut, microphone session and Accessibility insertion with
synthetic text and provides a two-second microphone check in its menu. The recording/insertion check starts after five seconds and submits after three seconds so a disposable editor can retain focus. It makes
no OpenAI requests, never reads your API key or history, and writes no audio.
It uses a separate preference domain. These checks are absent from release builds.

For a network-free indicator preview, also pass `--hud-preview`. It shows the
production panel alone; clicking its finish button switches the preview to the
spinner. Debug menu actions can show either state in the selected indicator style.
Previewing never records audio. The explicit two-second microphone check also
feeds the production level meter so the waveform can be checked without OpenAI;
its captured audio is discarded in memory. The debug application menu also
offers “Local check: start recording in 3 seconds” for switching windows during
a production recording session; stop with the HUD to deliver synthetic text
into the active field.
After a local recording, “Local check: retranscribe last recording in 3 seconds”
exercises the production retry lifecycle and delivery with synthetic text, without
reading credentials or calling OpenAI. The delay lets the fixture regain focus.

Use a disposable editor document to check final clipboard insertion, cancellation before
delivery, cursor movement, switching fields/apps, secure fields and clipboard restoration.
Test permissions granted/denied, startup, menu actions, both languages, Spaces,
full-screen windows and logout/login. A real OpenAI key is required to validate
provider access and transcription accuracy; mock tests cannot establish either.

## Google Drive synchronization

Changes sync after 15 seconds without edits; background checks run every 15 minutes.
Opening Settings or waking this Mac checks only if the last successful sync is at
least five minutes old. Network recovery resumes queued work; errors back off and
authorization failures pause automatic attempts. Unchanged Drive replicas are
cached only in memory.

Connect Google Drive in Settings to sync the dictionary, word replacements, dictation
mode and selected models with Android. It uses a Desktop OAuth client from the same
Google Cloud project as the Android client, browser sign-in with PKCE and a
temporary loopback callback listener. OAuth secrets/refresh tokens stay in a
separate device-only Keychain item. Sync runs while the app is running and never
includes API keys, audio or history. See [setup and format](../../docs/google-drive-sync.md).

## Packaging and releases

Both platform icons use the approved [shared application artwork](../../docs/app-icon.md).
macOS packaging renders the original Android vector without adding lighting or shadows.

`scripts/package.sh` emits `dist/macos/OpenDictate.app`, a universal DMG, and a
SHA-256 checksum. It validates both CPU slices, the bundle signature and the DMG.
After dragging OpenDictate to Applications, press Command + E in the disk image's
Finder window to eject it.
The image opens in icon view with one fixed row, left to right: **Applications →
Install OpenDictate.txt → OpenDictate.app**. Packaging requires Python 3
and installs pinned `ds_store` dependencies into an isolated `.build` environment
to generate Finder layout metadata. They are not included in the application.
The default uses an ad-hoc signature with a stable identifier requirement so
local Accessibility grants can survive rebuilds. This is not a Developer ID
signature or Apple notarization.

For Developer ID packaging, use an identity already present in the login
keychain, plus an existing `notarytool` keychain profile:

```bash
MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY='Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)' \
MACOS_NOTARY_PROFILE='opendictate-notary' apps/macos/scripts/package.sh
```

No certificate, private key or Apple credential belongs in the repository.
To release, update `VERSION`, `Resources/Info.plist` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, pass
platform checks, merge to main and push a matching `macos-vX.Y.Z` tag. Verify
the green release workflow, the DMG and checksum attachments before reporting
completion. macOS and Android versions are independent.

The [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/lebedev-nikita/homebrew-tap) checks for
stable macOS releases every six hours and verifies the DMG against its checksum
before updating the cask. Run its **Update OpenDictate** workflow manually to
publish a cask update sooner. It does not need an additional release secret.

Release candidates use `X.Y.Z-rc.N` in `VERSION`, the displayed app version,
DMG filename and `macos-v*` tag. The Apple bundle short version contains only
`X.Y.Z`, per Apple's
[bundle version format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleshortversionstring);
increment the numeric bundle build for each distribution. Release CI
marks RC tags as GitHub prereleases and leaves the stable download unchanged.
`scripts/test-release-version.sh` verifies accepted/rejected version strings.
