# Security

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories.
Do not include API keys, recordings, or other sensitive data in public issues.

Word replacements use literal, case-insensitive matches with Unicode word
boundaries. Rules are compiled once per dictation, operate only on recognized
text, and never alter the captured original field or voice-edit instructions.
Rules are applied on-device. Optional Drive sync uses the same app-data scope
for the rule list and enabled states.

Optional Accurate punctuation correction sends only recognized text directly to
OpenAI with Responses storage disabled. It is off by default, never runs on Live
or voice-edit instructions, and rejects output that changes word boundaries,
spelling, order, numbers or address contents beyond allowed capitalization.
Failures retain the original transcript; cancellation still prevents delivery.
The enabled switch, but no text, is on the Drive sync allowlist.

## Optional Google Drive synchronization

Sync uses Google's HTTPS endpoints without a backend, requests only
`drive.appdata` and exports an allowlist of dictionary, replacement, mode, model and Accurate punctuation settings.
API keys, audio and history are excluded. Tokens, dictionary/replacement contents and raw
provider payloads are never logged. Drive clients disable redirects, cookies and
persistent caches. Remote data is bounded and validated before application;
unknown keys survive, while unsupported versions stop sync.

Android uses Google Identity Services and Play services' token cache; Google
tokens are not stored in preferences. macOS uses the system browser, PKCE S256,
random OAuth state and a temporary IPv4 loopback listener. OAuth secrets and
refresh tokens use a separate device-only, non-synchronizing Keychain item.
Access tokens stay in memory. Disconnect stops local delivery and removes
macOS credentials, without deleting cloud data or revoking Google's grant.

Per-device replicas and per-field merge preserve concurrent writes. Incoming
settings do not change an active dictation's captured settings. See
[Google Cloud setup and verification](docs/google-drive-sync.md).

## macOS

The macOS app uses device-only Keychain credentials, ephemeral URLSession
connections to OpenAI over HTTPS/WSS, bounded in-memory audio and no audio
files. It never logs keys, audio, transcripts, field contents or raw provider
responses. Provider errors are mapped to safe status messages rather than
displayed verbatim. Text Responses requests disable storage.

Accessibility insertion checks the original process and exact element, current
text, selection and secure-field subrole before every write. UUID session guards
discard stale callbacks. Ordinary dictation captures the latest text and selection
in the original field immediately before delivery, preserving user edits. Voice
editing retains the original source guard. Text/selection changes during clipboard
staging reject delivery. Final clipboard delivery is directed at the original process
and rechecks the field before posting Paste. No AX text writes or app-specific
exceptions are used. Each paste is posted once and verified by text/caret readback.
Clipboard restoration is skipped
if another action changed the clipboard. Cancellation before final delivery leaves the original field unchanged. Secure fields and user-excluded apps are rejected before capture.

Ordinary shortcuts use exclusive Carbon registrations. Only configured Globe/Fn
or modifier-only shortcuts enable AppKit event monitors with Accessibility access;
they inspect key codes and modifier flags, never event characters. Monitor state
is in memory and removed on reconfiguration, shortcut recording or shutdown.
The temporary local shortcut recorder reads a key label only while focused.
No Input Monitoring permission is requested. Monitored shortcuts cannot suppress
other applications' or macOS's own keyboard actions.

Local transcript history has owner-only directory/file permissions and can be
disabled or deleted. macOS backup software is controlled by the user. Unlike
Android, macOS stores no retry recording. The app is not sandboxed because it
uses system-wide Accessibility insertion; its entitlements allow microphone input,
with macOS privacy permissions still required. It has no privileged helper.

Universal DMGs are built in GitHub Actions from `macos-v*` tags, with SHA-256
checksums. The initial release uses ad-hoc signing, not Developer ID signing or
Apple notarization; installation instructions disclose the Gatekeeper step.
Developer ID identities and notary profiles are supported for local packaging
but their certificates, private keys and credentials must stay outside Git.
Debug-only local smoke checks do not call OpenAI and are absent from release builds.

## Android

OpenDictate intentionally never logs authorization headers, API keys, audio,
transcript contents, transformation instructions, or focused-field text.
Model discovery calls OpenAI directly and stores only model IDs in app-private
preferences. The model list API does not supply endpoint capabilities or prices,
so the picker keeps the transcription aliases and up to five recent general GPT
text models, excluding Astra and specialized models.
The app exclusion picker queries launchable apps only. Excluded package names
stay in app-private preferences; the accessibility service checks them before
showing the overlay or starting an action.
Release signing material is expected to live only in GitHub Actions secrets.
The text selection and floating-menu actions store only selected text that the
user explicitly adds to the dictionary. The Share action stores only the shared
text. These actions do not log the text or read surrounding field contents.

Transcript history is stored only in the app-private SQLite database. Android
backup remains disabled. History search results are kept in memory, and AI
history search requests use the OpenAI Responses API with storage disabled.
The latest dictation audio is kept in one app-private WAV file and replaced by
the next dictation. It is excluded from Android backup with the rest of the app.

Completed text is copied to the Android system clipboard when it cannot be
inserted into the original field. Users can also explicitly copy an item from
history. The floating menu's Paste last action inserts text directly without
changing the clipboard. The fallback clipboard item is marked sensitive so
Android can conceal its preview; users should still treat the system clipboard
as shared device state.
